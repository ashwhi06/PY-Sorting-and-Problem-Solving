# Write your solution for algorithm 3 below
#3. Write an algorithm that takes in an unsorted numerical list as an argument and creates a new sorted list in descending order (use the sorted() function).

#The sorted() function sorts in ascending order, but it can sort in descending order by adding a reverse parameter with a boolean value of True.
